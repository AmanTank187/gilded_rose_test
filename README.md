# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
---------------------
## My Approach 

* The first step i took into completing this kata was to get an understanding of what i needed to do and what the current code was doing. I took a look at the requirements and did not fully get an understanding of what i needed to do. I went through each line one by and read it out loud to get a understanding of what was happening, After i figured out what was happening i wrote a comments throughout the code to identify what was happening. 

* I did not get a full understanding by this stage but i was capable to start writing tests, i went through the requirements again and wrote them out on paper in a way that made sense for me. This allowed my to test every possible outcome within the nest IF statements.
